The focus of the first part of the series was that the Hargreeves siblings, who were led by Number Five (Aidan Gallagher), had to save the world from its impending doom in eight days.&nbsp;</p><p>This time, however, the Hargreaves are headed back to the past, instead of to the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Number 5 brings his brothers and sisters to Dallas to avoid the threatening mess that Vanya (Ellen Page) created in the Season 1 finale.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>But, while the Hargreeves are all brought to the same location, they're each placed at different points within the three-year span leading up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Though it doesn't seem like the stakes could get any higher for Season 2, Number Five presents his siblings with more life-altering information: a nuclear explosion will decimate them all within seven days of their arrival.</p><p>As for what the siblings are facing in their new environments, it's been confirmed that Klaus (Robert Sheehan) becomes a pseudo-cult leader, and Luther (Tom Hopper) gets a job as a club bouncer. Meanwhile, Diego (David Castañeda) and Lila (Ritu Arya) are in a mental asylum together, and Vanya forges a strong connection with a housewife named Sissy (Marin Ireland).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The show takes some of the horrors of the Civil Rights era segregation head on, as Allison (Emmy Raver-Lampman) learns that she is not welcome at many Dallas establishments. She later connects with a group of women at a beauty salon, who are also Civil Rights activists.&nbsp;</p><p>The characters of Lila and Sissy were not in the comics, and they will be joined by fellow newcomer Yusuf Gatewood. Yusuf's character is Raymond, whose role within the plot is currently unclear.</p><p>The Season 2 villains are a trio of mute Swedish assassins, which is a big change from the antics of Cha-Cha (Mary J. Blige) and Hazel (Cameron Britton) from Season 1.</p><p>Season 2 is based on the second volume of the comic book series, which is entitled Dallas. It's unclear at this time how closely the show will mirror the plot of the comics.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In the comics, Number Five ultimately decides to assassinate the president himself, and he recruits the help of Allison (Emmy Raver-Lampman). When Allison takes the place of Jackie Kennedy in the car, Number Five is able to carry out the murder.</p><p>It is later revealed that Number Five and Luther are actually twins, which is why Allison decided to help. The second volume of the comics end with Vanya and Allison ending their feud, and with Luther nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fan-favorite characters Hazel and Cha-Cha don't appear to be in Season 2.</h2><p>The first season of The Umbrella Academy did stay fairly true to the comics, but that couldn't exactly happen for Season 2 for one main reason: casting.</p><p>Time-traveling serial killers Cha-Cha (Mary J. Blige) and Hazel (Cameron Britton) were key characters (and the villains that viewers loved to hate) throughout the first season, but they are not part of Season 2 at all.</p><p>Hazel managed to escape in the finale of Season 1, while Cha-Cha appeared to burn to death. While some fans hoped that Cha-Cha somehow survived the destruction, it doesn't appear as if she is part of the second season at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dallas comics featured both of these characters heavily, as they both followed the Hargreeves siblings throughout the three-year time span.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Of course, Netflix could be keeping the characters' return under wraps, in which case the show might be able to follow the plot of the comic books more closely.&nbsp;</p><p>Umbrella Academy Season 2 will be available to stream on Netflix beginning on July 31.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqrqjvsSlo5plkZiupbHMsmSsnZGovK95kWaqqaeZobKzvw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1297229-tamra-judge-bio-age-net-worth-husband-children-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tamra Judge bio: age, net worth, husband, children">&larr;
