It followed the lives of eight housemates spending their summers together mainly in Seaside Heights, NJ (aka the Jersey Shore), but the show also filmed in Miami, Fla. and Florence, Italy.</p><p>The series was known for its focus on partying, relationships, and the cast's unique personalities.</p><p>It introduced us to <a href=#>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi</a>, <a href=#>Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino</a>, <a href=#>Paul "Pauly D" DelVecchio</a>, <a href=#>Vinny Guadagnino</a>, <a href=#>Jenni "JWoww" Farley</a>, <a href=#>Sammi "Sweetheart" Giancola</a>, <a href=#>Ronnie Ortiz-Magro</a>, and <a href=#>Angelina Pivarnick</a>, who <a href=#>Deena Nicole Cortese</a> later replaced her in the series.</p><p>It's no secret that multiple cast members dated or hooked up throughout the OG series. Some of these dalliances were seen on the show, and others were behind the scenes and revealed later—sometimes even years later. So, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Who has dated and/or hooked up who within the Jersey Shore franchise?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Sammi and Ronnie dated for eight years. Sammi also claims to have made out with Mike.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Even if you've only watched a few episodes of Jersey Shore, you likely picked up on Sam and Ron being a couple throughout the series. And what a rollercoaster these two were! They dated on and off for eight years and broke up for good in 2019. Ron had been unfaithful to Sammi multiple times, and during Season 2, Snooki and JWoww wanted to warn Sam that her man had been up to no good, but they didn't want to ruin their friendship with him. The ladies decided to anonymously write a now-famous letter to Sam on Microsoft Word about his infidelities.</p><p>This letter, which has since become a viral meme, read: "Sam, The first night at Bed, when you left, Ron made out with 2 girls and put his head between a waitress's breasts. Also was grinding with multiple fat women. When you left crying at Klutch, Ron was holding hands and dancing with a female and took down her number. Multiple people in the house know; therefore, you should know the truth."</p><p>Furthermore, during a 2024 episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Sammi also revealed that she hooked up with Mike back in the day, clarifying that they only made out, but that it was with tongue.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Snooki hooked up with Pauly D in 'Jersey Shore' Season 1 ... and ended up in Vinny's bed multiple times. Mike claims they hooked up, too.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Snooki and Pauly D hooked up during Jersey Shore Season 1, but it was an isolated event.</p><p>Snooki and Vinny had a different situation, as they continually flirted with each other throughout the series. In Season 2, although Snooki was in a relationship with another man named Emilio, she gets into bed and has sex with Vinny for the first time. She does it again three episodes later. They continue to have impromptu hookups during the series.</p><p>When Vinny wasn't invited to Snooki's wedding to Jionni LaValle, many fans thought it was because they had history. However, Snooki confirmed that they had a falling out after he started using their hookups as standup comedy material.</p><p>"That’s why I kind of stopped talking to him for a little while," she told <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Life & Style</a> in a 2018 interview. "Just because I get it, it was in the past, whatever — but to use me for comic relief? Like, knowing that it’s not cool to talk about that anymore, you know, when I’m married — that’s just not really something a friend would do, you know?"</p><p>Snooki and Vinny have since reconciled.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>During Season 4 of Jersey Shore, Mike also claimed that Snooki gave him a blowjob, but this was never confirmed and caused tension between them as Snooki was dating Jionni by that point.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Mike, Vinny, and Pauly D had an orgy.</h2><p>Mike revealed in his tell-all memoir Reality Check: Making the Best of The Situation - How I Overcame Addiction, Loss, and Prison that after having a sexual encounter with a woman he met on a plane to California, where he was set to promote Season 1 of Jersey Shore, he invited her to meet with him in LA.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"This time, Vinny and Pauly were with me. Like Biggie said, I told her, 'Tell your friends to get with my friends, and we can be friends.' Let's just say she showed up with her two friends, I showed up with my two friends, and we ALL became friends," he revealed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Deena kissed Pauly D and Vinny.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jersey Shore (@jerseyshore)</a></p></figure><p>During Season 4 of Jersey Shore, Pauly D and Deena started making out in an episode, and Deena bit his lip during it. Pauly D didn't want to take it further following their seemingly violent tongue action.</p><p>Furthermore, during a Season 7 episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Deena was asked if she ever hooked up with Vinny, and she denied it. But her face said it all and she was caught in a lie. "I kissed Vinny once,” Deena finally admitted. It was like, before Italy. It was just a kiss. Now I look back, and I’m like, ew.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Angelina dated both Vinny and Mike briefly.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>Despite constantly bagging on each other, Angelina and Vinny did hook up during Season 2 of Jersey Shore. During Seasons 5 and 6, they begin to get flirty again, but ultimately Vinny gave a firm no to the idea of them dating. “Everybody wants that,” he previously told <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>. “Absolutely no. I mean, she's cool, but nah. There's no romantic connection there.”</p><p>Furthermore, during a Season 7 episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation that aired in 2024, Angelina surprised everyone by sharing how she and Mike went out on four dates and hooked up a few times before the OG Jersey Shore was filmed in 2009.</p><p>In Mike's memoir, he reflected on the fact that he and Angelina kept it quiet to MTV that they did know each other before being cast for the show. "[We] thought that would hurt the chances of being on a show that was, like, anonymous or something — you know, like, ‘Oh, all these people in the house, and everybody doesn’t know each other,'" he explained.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jwoww hooked up with Pauly D and Mike.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty images</span></figure><p>JWoww and Pauly D hooked up during Jersey Shore Season 1, which is where we that Pauly D had a piercing on his joystick.</p><p>JWoww also hooked up with Mike, but that got cut from the show. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, when a <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">fan on Reddit</a> asked if the JWoww and Mike hookup rumor was true, and a former producer responded with the facts, "They hooked up in Season 1, which is what fueled the punch in the mouth. [That] was later turned by the story production,” they explained.</p><p>“Originally, Jenni and Mike just made out, but Jenni definitely pursued him more when she was intoxicated,” they shared. “There were a few more intoxicated [arguments] during this season between these two."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecOaq56cXay1sHnOp2SjnaKosrp50qGmq50%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./breaking-wike-makinde-tambuwal-ikpeazu-storm-ondo-state-to-bring-former-governor-back-to-pdp.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wike, Makinde, Tambuwal, Ikpeazu Storm Ondo State To 'Bring' Former Governor Back To PDP">&larr;
