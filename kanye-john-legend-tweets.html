John wrote a measured reflection on the situation on his Twitter, but he didn't mention Kanye by name:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I imagine there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present.

But it didn't stay private for long. Kanye screenshot their alleged text exchange and put it on Twitter:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/L9a7OeywJ6</a></p>— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href=#>April 26, 2018</a></figure><p>In his message, Legend writes that he hopes Kanye reconsiders aligning himself with Trump, because he has enormous influence with his fans. He wants him to know how Trump's policies have particularly hurt people of color, and that it's a betrayal to them to back this administration. Kanye dismisses this as "manipulation."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Teigen also wrote on Twitter that she is getting messages to intervene with Kanye, and wants to make it clear that they have been trying:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everyone keeps asking me to comment on shit.
