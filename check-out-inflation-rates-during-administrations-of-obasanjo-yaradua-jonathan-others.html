The cumulative inflation rate over the period stood at 143.5% as the CPI surged from 31 to 75.4 index points.</p><p>In the same vein, his administration coincided with the global Great Recession, which affected the global financial market leading to several job losses and economic downturns.</p><h2><strong>Musa Yar’Adua (2007 – 2010) – 11%</strong></h2><p>An average inflation rate of 11% was recorded during Yar’Adua’s administration. The late politician took over the presidency in May 2007 following a 4.64% inflation but saw inflationary pressure gallop to 15.04% before he died.</p><p>However, Yar’Adua’s administration was marred with high insecurity in the Niger Delta and insurgency in the northern region&nbsp;of the country.</p><p>His administration recorded the highest inflation in February 2010 at 15.65%.</p><h2>Goodluck Jonathan (2010 – 2015) – 10.22%</h2><p>Jonathan, who was the vice of his Yaradua, inherited a high inflation rate. However, during his tenure, an average inflation rate of 10.22% was recorded</p><p>His entry rate was 15.04% but saw it decline to 9% at the end of his tenure while operating under similar macro and socio-economic conditions as his predecessor.</p><p>During the period, Nigeria also endured massive killings in the north by the Boko Haram insurgent group, although with a decline in the activities of the militants in the Niger Delta region, thanks to the Amnesty Programme established by the previous administration.</p><h2>Muhammadu Buhari (2015 – 2023) – 22.41%</h2><p>Between June 2015 and December 2022, Nigeria experienced an average inflation rate of 14.52%, recording a 17-year high of 21.34% in November 2022,</p><p>Buhari’s administration was characterised by high food prices, plummeting oil prices as an eventual surge in oil prices, high currency in circulation, and huge arbitrage in the FX market amongst others.</p><p>The crude oil crisis in 2016 coupled with the transition from the fixed FX regime to a flexible regime by the CBN also had a significant impact on Nigeria’s inflation.</p><p>Buhari, upon assumption of office as the president in May 2015, started with an inflation rate of 9 per cent, but handed over power on May 29, 2023, with the rate of a 13.22 per cent increase.</p><h2>Bola Ahmed Tinubu (2023-Present) – 29.90%</h2><p>President Tinubu inherited a high inflation rate from his predecessor.</p><p>However, the inflation rate has continued to increase since he took over power, a resultant effect of his economic policies and the removal of the fuel subsidy which he announced on the day of his inauguration.</p><p>A report from the<a href=#> National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)</a> has shown that the country’s inflation surged further in January 2024, hitting 29.90 per cent from the 28.92 per cent recorded in December 2023.</p><p>The statistics bureau detailed that the January increase was 0.98% higher than the 28.92 rate point recorded in December 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49rZpyglZi4brvUrWSippahrrW1zqdkq5mkmsBusNSroKefXZaxrrXNoqqtqpGptrC60mamn2Wfl660rc2jpmaxkaeupcHAZqGoppGptaK6jKiroZ2iqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fani-kayode-reacts-to-russia-attack-on-ukraine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fani-Kayode Reacts To Russia Attack On Ukraine">&larr;
