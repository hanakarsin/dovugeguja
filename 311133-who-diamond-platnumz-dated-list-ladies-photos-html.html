One would be forgiven for thinking that Diamond's dominance stops at his music. When it comes to women, it is not a secret that he is a pro, the best there is! He has the taste and finesses with his selections. He is unrivalled in this sector, thus earning him a crown as a playboy. Usually, one would be considered a playboy for having dated three or four women in his life. Platnumz has dated not three, not four or five for that matter but eleven women and counting. Does it stop?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f5d2802c93f1aa1.jpg><p class=align-left>While some people view success in dating as sticking with one woman for a long time, others rate their dating game by the number of women who have warmed their beds. Platnumz seems to belong to the latter as he has done quite the job of sampling the best when it comes to women. He may have started local but ended up crossing borders to find love in the neighbouring countries. Who is Diamond Platnumz wife and children? Here is a full list of all the women Diamond Platnumz has dated and children.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f51dc0587824a8f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rema Dons Harambee Stars Jersey, Enjoys Watching Wildlife in Kenya Ahead of Hyped Concert</span></p></a><h2>1.

Wema Sepetu</h2><p class=align-left>Wema Sepetu is a Tanzanian movie actress. Wema Sepetu and Platnumz have dated twice. They broke up the first time because Diamond cheated with one of Wema's friends. They would later reconcile, but the relationship caved in again with the two moving on with their lives. The relationship could not be salvaged because Diamond cheated numerously, prompting Wema to walk out.</p><h2>5. Penny Mungilwa</h2><p class=align-left>Penny Mungilwa was just another fling that Simba had to quench his insatiable appetite with. He had been cheating on Wema with Jokate Mwegelo to cheating on the two of them with Penny Mungilwa. Penny was Jokate's friend before this happened. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relationship did not materialize</a>, and Simba went back into the welcoming arms of Wema Sepetu once more.</p><h2>6. Jokate Mwegelo</h2><p class=align-left>Jokate is very beautiful and Wema Sepetu's biggest regret when it comes to dating Simba. Jokate was Sepetu's best friend at the time.

Jacqueline is one of those examples where musicians end up having an affair with women they have worked with. Jacqueline Wolper initially worked as a video vixen in some of his songs. Things then changed as the two became involved even though very little is known regarding the affair.</p><h2>8. Zari Hassan</h2><p class=align-left>Zari Hassan is a Ugandan socialite who has businesses in South Africa. It was one of Simba's most serious relationship, and he has two children to show for it. The boss lady is one of the women who have managed to have a long relationship with Diamond. During their time together they were envied as a hallmark of celebrity couples, Nillan and Tiffah.
