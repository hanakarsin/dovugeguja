"He's really good at what he does, and the fact that he's been fighting to make his own mark, he didn't want any help from me, I didn't help him get onto Ballers or anything like that. The only way I helped him get into Ballers was introducing him to football as a kid, so maybe that helped."</p><p>"But I'm just proud of he and all my children," he continued. "My wife did a great job, they are good kids. Humble, hard-working, not afraid of hard work, that's all you can ask for."</p><p>Don't miss Malcolm & Marie, streaming Feb. 5 on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ypuoydmK%2BhlGLEor%2FHoqWgrJ%2Bjeq%2Bx02auqKqknQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./police-arrest-israel-adesanya-in-new-york.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Police Arrest Israel Adesanya In New York">&larr;
