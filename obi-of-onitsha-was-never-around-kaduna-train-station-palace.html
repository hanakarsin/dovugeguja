In his brief goodwill message, he lamented the state of insecurity and violence in the country and drew attention to the train attack in which the Onitsha kingdom lost the young medical doctor, Chinelo Megafu.</p><p>“It was in that connection that His Majesty mentioned casually that the option of his travelling by train to Kaduna on that date had long been set aside in favour of road travel by mutual agreement with his hosts. No reference was made to any imaginary phone call from anyone. This has been His Majesty’s only public reference to the tragic train attack of 28 March.</p><p>“The news media were present at the Enugu meeting and one of them would be the likely source of the false and convoluted story claiming that His Majesty made the said statement on Saturday, 02 April 2022.</p><p>“Indeed, His Majesty was mostly engaged today with the Anambra peace meeting organised jointly by the new Anambra State Government of Mr. Governor, Professor Chukwuma Charles Soludo and the Joint Body of the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and the Archbishops/Bishops of the South East on Peace and Conflict Resolution.</p><p>“Other than delivering the keynote press statement of the occasion, His Majesty did not engage the media on any subject whatsoever.</p><p>“The entire country is in dire straits on internal security, and anyone could be a victim in the situation that we currently face, for instance, the unfortunate victims of the train attack. Thus, it is absolutely callous for anyone to use such a distressful national tragedy to grab fake media attention.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49sZqiamWK8p3nOp6Ctq5iWerit0malnq6Vp3qivs6upZ1lm5axtrrAZqurmZmjerTAwK2gqKZdpa6trcKeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gage-gomez-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gage Gomez - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
