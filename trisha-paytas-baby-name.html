Whether it be their sporadic kitchen floor meltdowns, affinity for all things pink and sparkly, laundry list of scandals, so to speak, and coming out videos ‚Äî not to mention when they dipped their toe into the world of Christian pop music ‚Äî Trisha Paytas has managed to entertain the <a href=#>YouTube</a> world for more than a decade. They never fell off!</p><p>In 2022, however, the chicken nugget icon's life is much less dramatic (we said less dramatic ‚Äî it's never drama-free). After wildly messy breakups with past boyfriends Jason Nash (who's famous for his role in disgraced YouTuber <a href=#>David Dobrik</a>'s Vlog Squad) and Sean van der Wilt, <a href=#>Trish married Moses Hacmon</a> ‚Äî an Israeli photographer and YouTuber ‚Äî in December 2021 after meeting through the H3 Podcast.</p><p>Not long after that, the <a href=#>duo announced they were pregnant</a>, despite Trish thinking they could never get pregnant naturally (peep their 2016 video "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WHY I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN | STORYTIME</a>").</p><p>"Love at first heart beat #happyvalentinesday," Trish wrote in an Instagram post on Feb. 14, 2022. Now that they're about nine months along, the eccentric duo must have a list of baby names they're considering. We're here to share the deets.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/blndsundoll4mj</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's Trisha Paytas' baby's name?</h2><p>Though Trish identifies as gender-fluid, they threw a gender reveal party for their bun in the oven. "IT‚ÄôS A GIRL," Trish wrote in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> on April 11, 2022.</p><p>They've shared much of their excitement throughout the baby-growing process. And while some mothers dread the pregnancy journey with all of its aches and pains, Trish is having a blast.</p><p style=text-align:left>"Never taking 'you look pregnant' as an insult again. Because I never felt sexier this way. Never glowed like I do being pregnant. Best time of my life and it‚Äôs going so fast," they gushed in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">August 2022 post</a>.</p><p style=text-align:left>Their caption continued: "34 weeks pregnant today!!!! Greatest gift of all will be here so soon. I‚Äôm already so grateful for her - she‚Äôs already changed my whole life, mind, and energy. As much as I love being pregnant with her and feeling her in my tummy every day, I can‚Äôt wait to hold her in my arms and be her mommy forever."</p><p>Considering Trish and Moses' baby is due in September 2022, the mama-to-be finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video</a> entitled "BABY NAME REVEAL, OLD FRIENDS I MISS, LIP INJECTIONS WHILE PREGNANT?!" on Aug. 10, 2022.</p><p>But, of course, knowing how click-baity YouTube titles often are, Trish didn't actually reveal the name of their unborn child.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/blndsundoll4mj</a></figure><p>"We have a baby name picked out. It's done, it's solidified. The only reason we're not saying it is ‚Äî like, honestly, you know me, I'd love to blurt it. I'd love to be like 'the baby's name is this.' But, like, I'm not superstitious, but I want to announce her name when she's here. It just seems fitting," Trish said in their video.</p><p>Trish clarified that it's possible said mystery chosen name might not strike them as fitting when their daughter is born. But they don't foresee that happening. "I really do feel like this is our baby's name," Trish said.</p><p>"Ultimately we want to see her, and have her into the world and have her energy here," Trish continued.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She has arrived.

Trisha also announced that the little bundle of joy's name is Malibu Barbie Paytas-Hacmon! As you might expect, the people of the internet had some real THOUGHTS about the name. For the record, we think it's kind of cute (and goodness knows there are plenty of not-so-cute names out there), but we couldn't resist sharing some of our favorite social media reactions to the announcement:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>trisha paytas didn‚Äôt just name her daughter malibu barbie <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CqRoL1EVTi</a></p>‚Äî Rachael (@markruffaloTD) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You know Trisha Paytas gonna call that baby ‚ÄúMali‚Äù like its a cute nickname and not how Billy Ray says his daughters name</p>‚Äî xCx (@xthrstx) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>trisha paytas naming her daughter "Malibu Barbie" is very unexpected but also expected</p>‚Äî ian (@ianisuglyyy) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>why you wouldn't keep name "elizabeth" I don't understand</p>‚Äî ‚ú® ùó∫ùüØùóüùó∂ùó•ùü¨ùòÉ (BS TWT SEXYMAN 2022) (@m3lir0v) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>MALIBU BARBIE BACKWARDS IS QUEEN ELIZABETH <a href=#>https://t.co/02fDHaPvVp</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bIftYP2gEm</a></p>‚Äî Riot Outhouseü™ê #SUNDAYBIRTHDAYBASH (@aspctoftwilight) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><p>In case you're confused about why people are talking about the queen, that's in reference to the <a href=#>conspiracy theory</a> that had Twitter buzzing when Trisha announced she was in the early stages of labor on the same day that Queen Elizabeth II died. The internet took that info and decided that ‚Äî obviously ‚Äî Trisha's baby must be the reincarnation of the queen. Trisha dispelled the myth on Sept. 9 by revealing in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> that she was still pregnant after all.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>normal people seeing why malibu barbie is trending <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cgTJB28gdT</a></p>‚Äî rotini targaryen (@courtYEET) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>in fairness to trisha, malibu barbie is the most trisha paytas name that she could possibly come up with. i wouldn't have it any other way, precisely on brand</p>‚Äî Fraser (@JediNabber) <a href=#>September 15, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Malibu Barbie kind of a slayful name for a baby like idk idk..
