Once we are all settled, the PDP and the other opposition parties can now have the rest. That is the plan on the ground.</p><p>“We know that all the APC lawmakers will get something; we are not just sure of who gets what.”</p><p>Another lawmaker from the South-East stated that priority would be given to lawmakers from the ruling party, but the APC would be fair to all.</p><p>“The party will be fair to all, but top priority will be given to lawmakers from the ruling party.</p><p>“Whether you are in Yari or Akpabio’s camp, everyone will get a good share. The rest can then be given to the opposition parties,” he said.</p><p>Recall that the Senate President had named the chairs and members of the special committees of the Senate.</p><p>Members of the Senate Selection Committee, mainly composed of the presiding officers and principal officers of the upper chamber, include Akpabio, Barau Jibrin, Opeyemi Bamidele, Ali Ndume, Dave Umahi, and Lola Ashiru.</p><p>Others are senators Simon Mwadkwon, Oyewumi Olarere, Darlington Nwokeocha, and Rufai Hanga.</p><p>Akpabio named Adeola (APC, Ogun West) as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and Ndume (APC, Borno South) as the vice-chairman.</p><p>Senator Titus Zam (APC, Benue Northwest) was named as the Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Business, with Bamidele (APC, Ekiti Central) as vice-chairman, while Senator Sunday Karimi (APC, Kogi West) was appointed Chairman, Committee on Senate Services, with Senator Williams Jonah named as his deputy.</p><p>Others are the Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges, and Public Petitions, with Senator Okechukwu Ezea (LP, Enugu East) as chairman and Khalid Mustapha as vice-chairman.</p><p>Also named was Senator Ahmed Wadada (SDP, Nasarawa West) as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Accounts and Senator Onyeka Peter Nwebonyi as the vice-chairman.</p><p>The Committee on National Security and Intelligence has Senator Shehu Umar (APC, Bauchi South) as chairman and Senator Asuquo Ekpenyong as vice-chairman.</p><p>In addition, the Senate Committee on Legislative Compliance has Senator Garba Maidoki (PDP, Kebbi South) as chairman and Senator Ede Dafinone as vice-chairman.</p><p>The Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs has Senator Adeyemi Adaramodu (APC, Ekiti South) as chairman and Senator Salisu Afolabi as vice-chairman.</p><p>Senator Francis Fadahunsi (PDP, Osun East) was on Wednesday named Chairman of the ad hoc committee on Customs to investigate the issue of open firearms. Other members of the committee are Shuaibu Lau (PDP, Taraba North); Kawu Suleiman (NNPP, Kano South); Tony Nwoye (LP, Anambra North); Umar Sadiq (APC, Kwara North ); and Akpan Samson (PDP, Akwa Ibom South), among others.</p><p>Also, on Thursday, Akpabio named Senator Danjuma Goje (APC, Gombe Central) as Chairman of the Committee on Internal Security. Other committee members include senators Sunday Marshall, Fadeyi Olubiyi, Elisha Abbo, Peter Jiya, and Sunday Karimi, among others.</p><p>Abdulaziz Yar’adua (APC, Katsina central), a retired colonel and brother to the late President Umar Yar’Adua, would be the chairman of the Defence Committee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FsZpqjoJavqruMn6CxnaNisaLAxGarqGWelrqmecKopKahpKmypnnCoZiiqp2au26t0maYqZtdoa64ucCknKurXam8brPErWSjrZmYxm6%2Fy6irrGWgmb1uuM9mpq2glafAbq7AraulnV2bvLN506GcZqqVqMFw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./arthur-phillip-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Arthur Phillip - Trivia, Family, Bio">&larr;
