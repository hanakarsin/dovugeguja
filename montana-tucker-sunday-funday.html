I think more than ever, the whole entire world is dealing with a lot of stress and heart ache right now and I want my song to make everyone put their worries aside and just have a good time and feel good. Sunday is usually a day that people rest, pray, take time for themselves, or spend time with their loved ones, so I want everyone to feel like it’s "Sunday Funday" whenever they hear my song!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you already have a viral TikTok dance in mind for fans to learn while listening to your single? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: Of course I do! I actually have a few fun TikTok ideas for the song besides just a dance! I can’t wait to see everyone’s videos!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I love the different decades portrayed in the music video. Was the video a complete collaboration or did you already have this idea in mind? Do you have a favorite outfit you wore in the video or a costume piece you kept? &nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Jamil Brown</span></figure><p><strong>MT:</strong> I had so much fun creating this video! I actually had the concept and idea in mind first and then I took it to the director / executive producer to make my vision come to life and they did an incredible job! I am truly obsessed with all of the decades but I think the '50s was my favorite since it was such a different look for me and made me feel like I was truly playing a character living back in the '50s!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How has social media helped you connect with fans or grow your platform? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>MT</strong>: Social media has truly been such a blessing for me. I have connected with some incredible people from all around the world and truly feel I have built a little family with fans. My fans also have become friends with each other which makes me so happy. We are all always there for each other!</p><p><strong>Is there a TikTok trend that you were not a fan of or were maybe reluctant to participate in? &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>MT:</strong> I think I would have to say the “WAP” challenge. I was extremely reluctant to post anything to it, which is why I finally made a joke out of it and posted a video to a funny remix someone made out of it!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You’ve previously talked about using DMs to collaborate with fellow artists. Who is the biggest celeb you’ve DMed (whether they’ve answered you or not)? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@montanatucker href=#>@montanatucker</a><p>You all asked... I delivered... <a title=wap href=#>##wap</a> <a title=wapchallenge href=#>##wapchallenge</a> <a title=fail href=#>##fail</a></p><a title="♬ WET AS FART - thejacksonjansen" href=#>♬ WET AS FART - thejacksonjansen</a></figure><p><strong>MT</strong>: I always connect with different creators and artists over DM! I would have to say the biggest celeb I’ve DMed has been Beyonce. Unfortunately, she hasn’t responded yet, but I still have hope.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You opened for Pitbull when you were 16 years old. Did you learn anything from watching him as a performer or did he give you any advice?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MT</strong>: It’s amazing that life happens in mysterious ways and that now I am signed to him. A piece of advice I got from him was, 'Hold on tight. It’s going to be a fun ride!' And it’s been such a fun ride so far!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s next for you heading into 2021? Will a tour be happening? &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>MT:</strong> If everything in the world opens up, I will definitely be traveling and performing. Also, A LOT of new music!</p><p><strong>Where do you see yourself in the next five years? &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>MT: </strong>My goal for the next five years will be to have toured the world and to have met all of my beautiful and amazing supporters. I also hope to have my charity going strong by then and have produced / directed / starred in some movies. I truly believe anything is possible if you don’t give up!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyvwMCnmGaspZi4pr6MrKynnJGueqfBzZ2Ysg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nigerians-in-shock-as-dj-cuppy-gives-tongue-to-tongue-kiss-to-one-of-her-dogs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigerians In Shock As Dj Cuppy Gives Tongue-to-tongue Kiss To One Of Her Dogs">&larr;
