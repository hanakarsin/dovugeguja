Exercising <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reduces anxiety</a> and stress, promotes sleep, and restores brain cells, among other things.</p><h2>Who is a fitness enthusiast?</h2><p class=align-left>This is an individual that is passionate about working out, hydrating, eating right, and having the perfect body and state of mind. Everyone wants to have that perfect body, but how many are willing to put in the hard work, spend time at the gym and deny themselves life's little pleasures that include junk foods?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1ff37673d11fe39d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 black couples goals that will make your love stronger</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Being fit takes effort. It takes a lot of time and sacrifices to be in shape. If you want to join the fitness club, you will have to drop some habits that are unacceptable in the gym.</p><h2>Top 10 habits of a fitness enthusiast</h2><p class=align-left>Working out is no joke as you use a lot of energy both inside and outside of the gym. Believe in yourself and trust that at the end of it, you will become fit and practice healthy living. The following are some of the habits fitness freaks adapt to stay in great shape:</p><h3>1. They try not to overeat</h3><p class=align-left>Serious dieters never overeat. They structure their meals and eating habits and stick to their plans. Fitness enthusiasts try to regulate their food consumption no matter how hard they get hit with the cravings. One way to help one regulate how much they eat and stop overeating is by calculating one's macronutrient needs per day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/54dc4c82d1e69694.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ inspirational yoga quotes about peace, meditation, and motivation</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There are several factors to consider before the calculations. They include checking one's weight, the activities one engages in, and the goals one has set. A simple formula to get one's caloric needs is multiplying your body weight by a multiplier which dictates how active you are and what your goal is.</p><h3>2. Fitness freaks write down their goals</h3><p class=align-left>In whatever they do, people who are passionate about fitness will always write down their goals. You should put down in writing what your targets are to achieve them swiftly. How many times do you jog in a day? Can you do heavy lifting bi-weekly?</p><p class=align-left>Should your exercise daily or skip some days? How much weight do you want to shed or gain? Writing all these things down will help you stay focused and committed to your workout sessions. Your longevity in fitness is determined by your set targets.</p><h3>3. Appropriately time their food</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2c8e2a9a4c1c0991.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sleep paralysis: 1-minute mental lockdown that leaves lifelong horrifying experiences</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to BarBend</a>, a food and nutrition resource, timing your food is crucial as nutrients in the body are handled differently during different times of the day. Gym enthusiasts and committed fitness individuals, make it a habit to take carbohydrates right after exercising.</p><p class=align-left>Consuming carbs after the exercise will help refill them. For fitness lovers that are working towards losing a little weight, the order of your food intake should be low carbohydrates, increased veggies, moderate fats, and a protein-dense intake.</p><h3>4. They stay hydrated</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1ff37673d11fe39d.jpeg><p class=align-left>Water is the most important liquid you can take. Staying hydrated even when not exercising is crucial as your body needs water to function well. As a fitness junkie, you should carry a bottle of water wherever you go.</p><p class=align-left>What do fitness enthusiasts like to put in a gym bag? They never miss their water bottle. They also have gym gloves, deodorant spray, a towel, sanitiser, and earphones, among other necessities. Remember that every time you exercise, you lose some water in your body in the form of sweat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/20391115a655f22a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to become a business-oriented person</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This water needs to be replaced regularly. Water intake will also increase your performance and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">helps with the digestion</a>. Eating food without taking water will have your food stuck and make your stomach bloated. Lack of water can also lead to indigestion and slowed-down metabolism.</p><h3>5. Avoid processed foods</h3><p class=align-left>Junk and processed foods may be doing more harm than good to your body. You may enjoy that plate of everything fried, not knowing that it is what is hindering you from getting fit. Fitness junkies are choosy with what they consume and so should you if you want that beach body.</p><p class=align-left>Foods that are processed are not the best, especially since they have high sodium and low fibre. You should avoid all foods that have chemicals for flavouring. All they do is leave you bloated and gradually make you obese. Stick to fresh and organic foods if you are serious about your fitness journey.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/90dd562f658d1a9f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dreads growth stages: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><h3>6. Get enough sleep</h3><p class=align-left>Any fitness addict will agree that sleeping for only a few hours is punishing your body. An adult should enjoy at least eight hours of sleep every night. Lack of sleep will drain your metabolism, causing you to burn calories at a much slower rate.</p><p class=align-left>Body exhaustion will make the digestion of carbohydrates difficult as body organs will be straining to perform their functions. When the body is tired, the energy production in the body gets lowered throughout the day. If you are a committed health enthusiast, getting enough sleep should be at the top of your priorities.</p><h3>7. Structure their workouts</h3><p class=align-left>As an aspiring fitness enthusiast, your workouts should not be done every time. Make a routine and stick to it. Choose a suitable time during the day and ensure that you work out during the set hours without fail.</p><p class=align-left>Make a list of the exercises you will engage in, set enough rest breaks, have proper rep counts, among others. If your goal is to lose weight, for instance, have your workouts with short rest breaks that last between 60 to 80 seconds while aiming for 10-20 reps per set. Compare your workout structure versus your goals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs2erjrflimk4g.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best dating sites for black women</span></p></a><h3>8. Do metabolism-boosting exercises</h3><p class=align-left>Metabolism-boosting exercises include running, swimming, aerobics, and walking. These exercises are recommended as they stimulate one's metabolism, helps you burn calories, and can even temporarily curb your appetite post-workout.</p><p class=align-left>The exercises will speed up your metabolism.

For fitness lovers that are working towards losing a little weight, the order of your food intake should be low carbohydrates, increased veggies, moderate fats, and a protein-dense intake.</p><h3>10. They are disciplined</h3><p class=align-left>Saying that you want to be fit is one thing and following a strict workout session is a totally different thing. Many people want to have the ideal body but cannot be disciplined enough to work out.</p><p class=align-left>Every fitness enthusiast takes working out and exercising as serious as any other work. They follow their work out routines, eat right, diet and observe fitness etiquette both inside and outside the gym.</p><p class=align-left>Continuous working out can be overwhelming especially for starters. Be disciplined enough to write down your goals, follow them and train hard. You can get an instructor to push you if you are not confident about you being disciplined.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f2b9a6d8f39142ce.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a water bottling company in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>11. They eat metabolism-boosting foods</h3><p class=align-left>Fitness enthusiasts consume metabolism-boosting foods. These are protein-rich foods like fish, meat, eggs, dairy products, legumes, zinc, and cacao. Make a routine to have a glass of green tea or something similar after taking your supper.</p><p class=align-left>This will speed up your metabolism and increase the chances of processing the food quickly. Make this a habit if you want a flat tummy and not sleeping with a bloated stomach.</p><p class=align-left>Some people have cheat days when working out or following strict workout routines.
