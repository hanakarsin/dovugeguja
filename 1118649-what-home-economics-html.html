Although it was mostly meant for girls and young women, these days, all genders are involved in home economics classes.</p><p class=align-left>Other names that are used for this subject are domestic economy, human sciences and home science. The subject went from being compulsory to being an elective; some countries got rid of it altogether.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49581010aebd09f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Benefits of social studies</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even though many countries still use the term ‘home economics’, other states decided to change the name of the subject to family and consumer sciences. This way, the name reflects the whole scope of what this subject covers. And that is exactly what we are going to talk about in the next section.</p><h2>Branches of home economics</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49581010aebd09f7.jpg><p class=align-left>The scope of home economics covers seven main branches:</p><p class=align-left><strong>★ Cooking.</strong> Home economics lessons teach children and young people what to do in the kitchen: from setting the table to baking cookies and cakes. In home economics, kids can learn about the food’s nutrition value, the proper rules of etiquette and ways of handling kitchen equipment.</p><p class=align-left><strong>★ Child rearing. </strong>Back in the day, young girls were taught how to raise children from birth to early adolescence. Today, child development has developed into a separate field, but the basics are still taught in home economics.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7s4nv395kae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What effect does corruption have on Nigeria?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>★ Community awareness and education.</strong> This branch of home economics provides the basic knowledge on how to live in a community. Additionally, students can learn about morality and ethics in these lessons.</p><p class=align-left><strong>★ Design and home management. </strong>In these lessons, young people receive lessons on interior and exterior design, as well as learn how to take care of their homes (i.e. how to clean and organise).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1lgqmqr0qi7o.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>★ Textiles and sewing.</strong> Home economics teaches kids how to embroider, sew, crochet, and do all kinds of things with different kinds of threads and fabrics. Young people can learn how to make their own clothes, elements of décor or accessories.</p><p class=align-left><strong>★ Economics and budgeting.</strong> As one of the most essential elements of home economics, these lessons are meant to teach children how to spend money wisely and how to get the best out of their financial situation. It is one of the most important things that can be used later in life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4i31591pr7p.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Importance of economics in our life</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>★ Hygiene and health. </strong>These lessons are supposed to teach young kids how to take care of their own hygiene and health, as well as how to care for their sick relatives. This branch is rarely in use, but you can still find the remnants of it in some home economics programmes.</p><h2>Importance of home economics</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7s4nv395kae.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Education in Nigeria: old and new curriculum</p><p class=align-left>After talking about different branches of home economics, it would make sense to talk about why all of them are important. There are five main ways in which home economics classes are important:</p><p class=align-left>☆ Lessons on safety. Not all parents teach their kids how to deal with sharp or hot objects around them. That is why it is important that children learn it somewhere. In their lessons on cooking or sewing, home economics teachers are responsible for teaching their students how to deal with knives, hot stoves, needles etc. Additionally, kids can learn how to prevent and deal with dangerous situations at home.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt68u9j6dgidv.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Important role of home economics and households in modern society</span></p></a><p class=align-left>☆ Learning proper nutrition. Even though it is not exactly explicit, home economics teach children the importance of proper nutrition. In the cooking lessons, teachers give kids some information on the nutritious qualities of the food they are cooking. In addition, many teachers implement topics of healthy eating habits in their lessons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2s994rplqht.jpg><p class=align-left>☆ Useful life skills. Home economics is one of the most useful lessons taught in schools. While other subjects focus on theory and things that most of us will never use, home economics give useful tips on how to deal with everyday things. Not many people need to use Pythagorean Theorem, but everyone needs to know how to cook, clean and pay bills.</p><p class=align-left>☆ Living in a community. As many people go to colleges and universities after school, they need to be able to coexist with other people in small spaces of their dorms. In school home economics, they can learn how to share responsibilities with roommates.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt64t1bk77oj4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Physical and health education in Nigeria: issues and challenges</span></p></a><p class=align-left>☆ Knowing how to be a good parent. Even if you do not plan to have kids, it is still important to learn how to deal with them. One can always use this knowledge to take care of younger siblings, friends’ children, or work in the child care sector.</p><h2>Careers in home economics</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4i31591pr7p.jpg><p class=align-left>Home economics is not only a school lesson you like to skip. It is also a viable career opportunity. People who choose to study home economics can find a job virtually in any field. Below, you can find some ideas on who you can work as after studying home economics.</p><p class=align-left>Home economics graduates are always welcome in education. They can choose to work in schools or even in universities (if they have the required qualifications). However, teaching is not limited to schools. Non-profit organisations and community programs can also be great work places for home economists.</p><p class=align-left>The fashion industry is full of people who excelled at home economics. The skills learned in those lessons can be applied to designing and sewing fashionable outfits. The interior and exterior design scene is also an appropriate career opportunity.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5up4nul081.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Npower online registration 2017/2018 - How to apply?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt13nch8uma7m.jpg><p class=align-left>Service industry is always in need of workers, and home economics prepares people that are just right for it.
