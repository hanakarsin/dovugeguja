Ever since then, her fans have been wondering what’s Akothee’s health status. Is she fine? What made her faint?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/a22a6793c621bf8b.jpeg><p class=align-left>One of the most celebrated yet controversial musicians, Akothee, was hyping her audience during the Luo Festival when she collapsed on stage. Though the dancers caught her before she could hit the ground, the audience was in utter shock.</p><h2>Akothee’s health update</h2><p class=align-left>Here is an update on how it all went down now and how she is at the moment:</p><h3>Akothee collapses on stage</h3><p class=align-left>On the 30th of November 2019, celebrated singer Akothee was among the performers who graced the prestigious Luo Festival that took place in Kisumu. From the video clip that has made rounds all over the various social media platforms, the controversial musician is seen engaging her fans in a vigorous dance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9e72eac99897e408.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jovial Tells Women Rebuking Her over Rashid Abdalla Dance to Fix Their Homes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She was performing her latest hit song dubbed Rollam before she fell backwards on the stage. The incidence was so sudden and unanticipated that it caught a majority of the audience off-guard. Many of them were seen looking utterly surprised when they found her lying on the ground.</p><h3>Instant first aid</h3><p class=align-left>Immediately after the incident, her dancer, together with her security team, took her off the stage and went to offer first aid. She had successfully run her 45 minutes set only to collapse during the final 30 seconds of the song. The fainting was caused by the vigorous up and down activities that made her lose her breath.</p><p class=align-left>Oaks and the dancers didn’t have to go all the way to the hospital. Instead, they took her into the car for first aid. She was given a glass of juice and vitamins, which helped her to recover slowly into the ordinary self. Although she has been resting at the Acacia Hotel, she will soon be headed to her Rongo Spa Home as the doctors recommended she takes a bed rest for two weeks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3c27cb71379059cf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ann Wamuratha Defends Herself in Cake Saga: "I'm Not a Bad Person, Just Had a Bad Day in Office"</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Singer Akothee admitted to hospital days after returning home</p><h3>Akothee admitted to hospital</h3><p class=align-left>Two days before the incident, Akothee had just been discharged from Karen hospital, where she had been admitted and diagnosed with flu and fatigue. This took place a few days after arriving from Dubai.</p><p class=align-left>She went ahead to assure her loyal fans that she was fine as well as warning the bloggers from creating exaggerated stories from her health condition.

My system just shut down. I will be back.<h3>Akothee health update and explanation from her manager</h3><p class=align-left>With her huge fan base, people have been eager to find out Akothee’s latest health update and what could have caused the collapse.
