After getting married in 2015, she and Dillon waited several years (which is also rare for a Duggar) before having a baby. Amy gave birth to son Daxton Ryan King in October 2019.</p><p>If you lost count, that means two Duggar couples are currently pregnant (at least that we know of). Many have grown up with the Duggars, and it's evident that the next generation is well on its way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydrKCfkafAbq3RnmSpqpWcu6K60w%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./652923-fast-rising-nollywood-actress-dies-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fast Rising Nollywood Actress Is Dead">&larr;
