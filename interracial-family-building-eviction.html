The letter writer basically threatened them to leave their neighborhood within 60 days and assumed the family were renting from a (presumably white) homeowner.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>The letter's author clearly has a problem with Marc and his obviously adorable family. He and his wife, Sandy, have three gorgeous little kids together and live in Vacaville, California. They're die-hard Golden State Warriors fans (lucky them, but I'd imagine they took that Cavs comeback pretty hard) and appear to be generally cool, awesome, and hardworking people.</p><p>But for some reason, whoever wrote the letter didn't see a college graduate who secures home mortgages for people, or a father who helps manage Girl Scout Troop 30477. They saw a non-white man married to a non-white woman of a different race — someone who couldn't possibly afford to live in the Meadowlands neighborhood, which I guess has been enjoying 20 years of cleanliness, quiet, and very little crime.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: facebook</span></figure><p>And apparently all of that would change now Marc and his family had moved into the area. Just take a look at the letter he received in his mailbox — it's infuriating.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: facebook</a></figure><p>There's one little problem, however: Marc actually owns his home. In fact, he makes his living helping others secure gome financing. The fact that he was able to get a crib in a nice area indicates he's not only very good at his job but has attained a certain level of financial success with it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: facebook</span></figure><p>What's craziest about this entire situation is that, according to local news station KTVU, Marc said that on his block alone, 7 of 8 properties house interracial families.</p><p>One neighbor in the Meadowlands area, Kelly Natividad, couldn't believe the letter Marc received:</p><p>"As I kept reading it, it just got worse and worse and very offensive. It’s just frustrating to know that [there are]&nbsp;people [who] are obviously racist in our community," she said.</p><p>Vacaville Police are looking into the matter and Lt. Mark Donaldson said they're investigating the note and taking it very seriously, "It’s very disturbing. Very troubling. I think it’s always best to err on the side of caution, allow us to look into the matter to find out the history. At this point we don’t know if there’s any crimes."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: facebook</span></figure><p>As horrifying and gross as it is for Marc to receive a letter like this, at the very least he knows &nbsp;he and his family are surrounded, for the most part, with neighbors who care &nbsp;and are equally disgusted by the surprise notice he received. Generally, there's always more good than bad, which is a comforting though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnru1sdGrmJyhkaF6p63MoqOyZZKqtq2wyKeeZp2mnrC1tc6n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./it-is-worrisome-that-someone-who-has-never-won-election-in-his-ward-is-asking-for-uzodinma-to-be-sacked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'It Is Worrisome That Someone Who Has Never Won Election In His Ward Is Asking For Uzodinma To Be Sa">&larr;
