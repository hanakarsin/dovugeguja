By the end of the season, she was finally accepted back to Harvard and in Season 8, Jazz had finished her first year of study. But what is Jazz's major at Harvard? Because she left school before she could really dig her heels into her education, it's almost like she's starting over.</p><p>And in some ways, that's not such a bad thing. When Jazz left Harvard, she did it for her mental health. She was overwhelmed and her anxiety and depression were at an all-time high. She gained close to 100 pounds, and it took some time to focus on her physical and mental health. Now, in Season 8 of I Am Jazz, she has reclaimed control over her life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Jazz Jennings' major at Harvard?</h2><p>After Jazz was originally accepted in 2020 and went with Harvard as her college of choice, she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> with TLC online to announce her choice and her potential major. At the time, she said she hoped to major in "philosophy, gender, and religion." But, she added in the video, she would figure things out once she officially started school.</p><p>Since then, Jazz hasn't specifically stated what her major is — or even if she's officially declared one at this point.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jazz Jennings returned to Harvard in Season 7 of 'I Am Jazz.'</h2><p>The driving force behind Jazz's storyline in Season 7 was her desire to go back to school. She explained on I Am Jazz that admissions officials at Harvard laid out conditions for her to return, which included setting up a therapist near the school and maintaining an internship to prove she can work hard at something before she heads back to college.</p><p>Jazz did both of those things. And, toward the end of the season, she got her re-acceptance letter to Harvard. It's an exciting moment for her, even if her mom, Jeanette Jennings, wasn't so sure her youngest child is ready to be off on her own.</p><p>To be fair, there was a scene in the season when Jazz called her mom from the grocery store because she was a little lost on what to buy. But Jazz is also in her early twenties and still figuring things out like her peers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jazz (@jazzjennings_)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jazz showed an interest in the medical field on 'I Am Jazz.'</h2><p>Some I Am Jazz fans were curious if Jazz is pursuing a career in the medical field. Her <a href=#>internship</a> in Season 7 was with plastic surgeon Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher. Jazz helped with clerical work and assisted in speaking with patients who needed gender confirmation surgery or other smaller procedures relating to their transition.</p><p>Jazz even got to sit in on a major surgery in the Season 7 finale. She said in the episode that watching Dr. Gallagher operate was like watching "art" and she had a genuine interest in it. Jazz even told her family that the specific field of medicine, in which a surgeon helps transgender individuals reach their potential and make their dreams come true, is something that resonates with her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"It was pretty masterful, to watch Dr. Gallagher work," Jazz said in the Season 7 finale. "She was able to stitch up everything super meticulously and the way she did the stitching was just so fast … she's an artist. Plastic surgery is like art, so to be able to do something like that, to change people's lives in that way, like, it's everything I stand for. And I definitely am not eliminating medical school as an option for me."</p><p>Watch I Am Jazz on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn667xoyjnKemmaO0tHnHmqmvmaKZeq6tyaip</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pdp-crisis-wike-rejects-moves-to-resolve-issues-with-atiku-insists-ayu-must-resign.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wike Rejects Moves To Resolve Issues With Atiku, Insists Ayu Must Resign">&larr;
