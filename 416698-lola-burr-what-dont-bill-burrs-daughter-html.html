So, here are some facts about Lola.</p><h3>1. She has mixed ethnicity</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1f77107a3d2287d3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Lola carries mixed ethnicity from her parents. Comedian Bill Burr is Caucasian, with German and Irish roots, while his wife Nia is African-American. This combination could be the reason for Lola's <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/396795-list-black-hair-types-identify-pictures.html href=#>black curly hair</a>.</p><h3>2. Lola was born in Los Angeles, California</h3><p class=align-left>The celebrity kid was born in Los Angeles, California, USA, where she lives with her parents. The couple settled there shortly after they met in 2009, in a comedy show they were working on together.</p><p class=align-left>Nia moved in with Bill shortly after they started dating. Unknown to many, Bill and Nia attended Emerson College, but they did not meet there.

Her face has not been revealed on any social platform</h3><p class=align-left>Lola's parents have been deliberate about keeping their daughter's face hidden. Photos of Bill Burr's daughter on social media show her back or have something covering her, so her face remains hidden.</p><h3>5.
