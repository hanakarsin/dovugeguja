I have learnt that performance is not a good thing when in government. Had I then read “48 Laws Of Power by Robert Green”, I would certainly have been re-appointed. I made huge mistakes - I tried to over-perform," said Nyakera.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/5b7fbcf33612690d.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>13kgs piece of moon that fell on earth up for sale at KSh 250M</p><p class=align-left>According to Nyakera, the CS who noted his commitment to excellent service delivery had advised him that government has no superstars and whoever tries to be one never lasts longer in office.</p>"The CS cautioned me a little too late. They told me there is no superstar in government. I trusted some people too much, I outshone others, said more than necessary and this made me appear perfect. I was young and came from nowhere as I didn't have a godfather," he said.<p class=align-left>He however, stated he had no scores to settle with government since Uhuru had honoured him by appointing him to work in his administration but reiterated it was important for Kenyans to speak and make Kenya a better country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/9cd8f822e0d887ef.jpeg>"I don’t criticise government to settle scores - actually I have no scores to settle as I was truly honoured to have been appointed by the president. But if we all keep quiet when our voices can help build a better Kenya, we will not be remembered as honourable. We will have failed. As such, I will always raise my voice, but always respectfully," he added.<p class=align-left>The Starehe Boys Centre alumni was dismissed along 11 other Principal Secretaries when Uhuru named his second-term Cabinet in January, 2018.</p><p class=align-left>Nyakera who said new doors had opened for him is the current Chairperson of Political Parties Liaison Committee and a Deputy Party Leader of Democratic Party of Kenya.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Story By: Ndung'u Gachane, TUKO Correspondent, Murang'a County.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left><i><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
