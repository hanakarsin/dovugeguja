In the true character of traditional politicians who move from one place to another, he was in PDP, from PDP to APC and then the Labour Party and we won’t be surprised if he goes back to his vomit and embraces either APC or PDP all over again. It is all about where food is ready.</p><p>“Labour Party is an ideological party, it has a clear-cut ideology which supports equal opportunity and social justice. It is specifically not a place for people like Doyin Okupe.</p><p>“Our system in the Labour Party does not support political opportunists. The system will naturally expose such political characters and eject them.</p><p>“I ask again, had Labour Party declared winner of the presidential election, will Okupe remain with the party or jump ship in adherence to his ideological leaning.</p><p>“We must recall that Okupe was forced to abdicate office half way into the campaign because of the baggages he came with from the other party where he served.</p><p>“The courts whipped him into early political menopause, so he really didn’t contribute much into the Labour Party’s success in the 2023 electoral voyage, however we are glad he acknowledged that we offered him shelter.</p><p>“Finally, the leadership of the Labour Party wishes him well in his future political adventure. We will however remain positive that a new Nigeria is still possible.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BpZrCgkal6rLXNnWSonl2lvK2106KamqRdna6zuM6tqbJlp5q%2FpnnYqKxmnaidtqO106KloGWSrnqrwcypoKefXZu%2FsLmMqKWeZaCWv7XFjK2mZpmepMGpsdFmo6llm6O8pLfSZqakraCafA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-i-am-now-attracted-to-men-my-aunties-age-bbnaija-uriel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Why I Am Now Attracted To Men My Aunties' Age">&larr;
