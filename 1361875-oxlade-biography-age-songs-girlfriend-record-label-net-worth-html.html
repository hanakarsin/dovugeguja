The singer is currently 25 years old (as of 2022), having been born on 22 April 1997. Where is Oxlade the musician from? He was born and brought up in Surulere, a residential area of <a href=#>Lagos</a>. He grew up under his father and grandmother's care after losing his mum at a very young age.</p><p class=align-left>Oxlade's dad was a lecturer at the Lagos State University, the same institution Oxlade later enrolled in.</p><h3>What tribe is Oxlade?</h3><p class=align-left>The renowned singer is of Yoruba descent. The Yoruba ancestral homeland spreads across the southwestern parts of Nigeria, Togo, and <a href=#>Benin</a>. There are currently more than 35 million Yorubas.</p><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>While most of Oxlade's fans probably know him for his secular songs, the <a href=#>renowned singer</a> began his musical journey in church. He was a junior choir leader at his local church when he was about ten years old.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3f0be430c55fef5a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kecalf Cunningham’s biography: Who is Aretha Franklin's son?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This puts him in the company of other celebrated Nigerian artists whose musical journey began in the church. These include Don Jazzy, Chidinma, and <a href=#>Wizkid</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Years later, Oxlade transitioned from gospel to secular <a href=#>music</a>, a move that was massively unpopular among his kin. His father and maternal uncles were overly critical of the decision to the point where they stopped providing any kind of support.</p><p class=align-left>Oxlade then dropped out of Lagos State University to pursue his career. At the time he dropped out, he was enrolled in a History and International Relations degree program. The singer's big break came when Blaqbonez offered to work with him after listening to one of his tracks.</p><p class=align-left>The two worked together and released a track titled <i>Mamiwota </i>that became an instant hit. This marked a new page in Oxlade's rise to prominence in the Nigerian and global music industry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/64c3b619267e2ae6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cute Abiola’s biography: age, full name, wife, net worth, comedy</span></p></a><h4>Oxlade's <i>Away </i>track and <i>Oxygene </i>EP</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4cab5a0a32a952d5.jpg><p class=align-left>Which Nigerian singer sang <i>Away</i>?

The EP (extended play) comprised six songs; <i>Away, Kokose, Weakness, Hold On, Tables Turn, </i>and <i>O2</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Oxlade's <i>O2</i> and <i>Away </i>tracks were particularly successful, with the latter garnering more than 3 million views a year after its release. <i>Oxygene </i>combines sounds and rhythms from neo-soul, Afropop, and R&B and blends them into some of today's best-sounding tracks.</p><p class=align-left><i>Away</i>, the first track off the album with a video is beautifully scripted and shot in the coastal town of Cape Coast in Ghana. The song revolves around a guy waiting for his lady love to join him. He then whisks her away on a trip as her parents look on.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ac9c5f7c35ca34f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Singer Barry Jhay’s biography: age, father, net worth, music</span></p></a><h4>Other Oxlade's songs</h4><p class=align-left>Besides tracks from <i>Oxygene</i>, the singer has also produced several other tracks.

Besides the tape, there were also several photos showing the <a href=#>renowned singer</a> in the nude.</p><p class=align-left>A Snapchat streak gets created when one sends direct snaps back and forth with a friend for several consecutive days. His friend then allegedly leaked the pics and clip on the internet. The singer later came out to apologize to his fans and to the mystery woman on the tape.</p><p class=align-left>He made a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post on Twitter</a> stating that he was not the kind of person to put his business out there and that he was betrayed. The <i>Away </i>singer went on to say that the woman in the video did not deserve the kind of exposure she got after the tape leaked.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/36e82165afd1d4e7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Can Yaman?

Eventually, the girl returned to her former lover after being advised that Oxlade would give her no attention once he became famous.</p><p class=align-left>Oxlade is undoubtedly one of the fastest-rising young singers in Nigeria. Just like many other up-and-coming artists, he has faced several challenges and still emerged strong.
